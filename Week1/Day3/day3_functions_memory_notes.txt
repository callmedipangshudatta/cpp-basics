DAY 3 — FUNCTIONS & MEMORY BASICS (MAANG LEVEL)

====================================
1) WHY FUNCTIONS EXIST (CORE TRUTH)
====================================

Functions exist for 3 reasons ONLY:

1. Reusability
2. Abstraction (hide complexity)
3. Stack discipline (controlled execution)

If you can’t explain what a function does to memory,
you DO NOT understand functions.

------------------------------------
Mental Model:
------------------------------------
When a function is called:
- A new STACK FRAME is created
- Parameters + local variables live there
- After return → stack frame is destroyed

====================================
2) FUNCTION DECLARATION vs DEFINITION
====================================

Declaration:
- Tells compiler: "This function exists"
- No memory allocated

Definition:
- Actual body
- Code is placed in memory (text segment)

Call:
- Push arguments
- Jump to function
- Execute
- Return value
- Pop stack frame

====================================
3) PARAMETER PASSING
====================================

PASS BY VALUE:
- Copy is made
- Original variable is SAFE
- Slower for large objects
- Default in C++

PASS BY REFERENCE:
- Alias is created
- Original variable CAN change
- Faster
- Dangerous if misused

Interview Rule:
"If function needs to MODIFY → pass by reference
 If not → pass by value or const reference"

====================================
4) SCOPE & LIFETIME
====================================

SCOPE = where variable is visible
LIFETIME = how long variable exists in memory

Local variable:
- Scope: inside function/block
- Lifetime: until function ends

Global variable:
- Scope: entire file
- Lifetime: entire program
- MAANG hates globals unless justified

====================================
5) INLINE FUNCTIONS
====================================

Inline = request compiler to replace function call
with function body

Why?
- Remove function call overhead

Why NOT always?
- Code bloat
- Cache inefficiency
- Compiler decides anyway

Rule:
Small, frequently called → inline
Big logic → NO inline

====================================
6) STACK vs HEAP (INTRO ONLY)
====================================

STACK:
- Fast
- Automatic
- Function calls
- Local variables

HEAP:
- Slow
- Manual (new/delete)
- Large data
- Dynamic lifetime

If you don’t know where your variable lives,
you don’t control your program.

====================================
7) INTERVIEW CHECKPOINT
====================================

If interviewer asks:
"Why use functions?"

Answer:
"To structure execution, reuse logic, and control
stack-based execution flow safely."

Anything else → amateur answer.
